# forms-runner

Citizen-facing forms using a config driven Node application.

This repository is forked from [the old Defra digital form builder](https://github.com/DEFRA/digital-form-builder).
These projects has been adapted to run several configurations on a single instance.

> DEFRA's digital form builder is a metadata-driven framework that builds on our robust,
> enterprise backend tech stack and the new gov.uk frontend Design System and allows form based gov.uk sites to be easily
> built using a graphical design tool.

The designer is no longer a plugin and is responsible for running itself on default port 3000.

# Testing

Tests are found inside `test/cases`. For test scripts, name them `${NAME}.test.js`.

# Outputs

At the end of a form, there are multiple output types. The schemas for the right json format can be found in the engine repo.
Additional steps are required for the different output types.

- Notify
  - A GOV.UK [notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk) is required
  - For each notification you wish to send, a template must be set up. If there are 'personalisations' they must match the configuration
